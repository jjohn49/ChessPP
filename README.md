## Notes for V1.1:

* 1.The graphics can be a little bit finnacky, but it still works.
* 2.In order to promote a pawn, you need to check the console and input the piece you would like.
* 3.The Game does not tell you when you are in check / check mate, however, it will not let you place a piece if you are checkmated or in check after said move.
* If you play a move that gets you out of check, the game will respond normally.
